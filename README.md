This project uses a Teachable Machine image model to classify images into two categories: watermelon and banana.

## Description
A pre-trained model built with Teachable Machine is used to identify whether an input image shows a watermelon or a banana.

## Files Included
- keras_model.h5 – Trained image classification model  
- labels.txt – Class labels (watermelon, banana)  
- test.jpg – Sample image for testing  
- predict.py – Python script for running predictions  
- result.png – Screenshot of the prediction output

## ⚙How to Use
1. Make sure all files are in the same directory.  
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python predict.py

## Output
The output will look like this:
Prediction: banana
